Import Libraries → Load all required ML, preprocessing, and plotting packages.

Load Data → Read test & train CSV files and merge into one dataframe.

Label Encoding → Convert Gender and Age categorical values into numbers.

One-Hot Encoding → Convert City_Category (A, B, C) into dummy numeric columns.

Fill Missing Values → Replace NaN in Product_Category columns with mode value.

Clean Data → Remove “+” in Stay_In_Current_City_Years and convert to int.

Visualization → Plot bar graphs (Age vs Purchase, Occupation vs Purchase).

Split Data → Separate rows having Purchase (train) and missing ones (test).

Select Features → X = independent variables, y = target (Purchase).

Train-Test Split → Divide into training (67%) and testing (33%) sets.

Drop Unnecessary Columns → Remove Product_ID before scaling.

Feature Scaling → Standardize X using StandardScaler (fit_transform & transform).

Model Training → Train Linear Regression model on training data.

Prediction → Predict Purchase for test data.

Residual Plot → Visualize prediction errors (pred - y_test).

R² Score → Evaluate model accuracy (how well predictions fit actual data).
